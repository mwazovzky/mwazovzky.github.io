# General Information

I am a professional fullstack web developer with years of experience
still passionate about modern web technologies.

I am responsible person always focused on goals/result,
I can efficiently organize my work,
may break down complex task/project to manageable steps and execute them.

I have experience of working within agile environment (scrum with weekly sprints)
as well as doing project under traditional (waterfall) project management approach.

## Technology Stack
**backend:** PHP/Laravel/Symfony, GO,   
**frontend:** JavaScript/ES6, Vue/Vuex, CSS/SASS, Webpack,   
**database:** MySQL, MongoDB, Redis,    
**search:** Algolia, Elasticsearch,   
**tools:** Git/Bitbucket/Jira/Confluence, Docker,   
**testing:** PHPUnit, Jest, Mocha/Chai/Sinon,    

I have experience with RESTful API design and consumption, Oauth2 authorization, social network API, specifically Twitter and Facebook.

I use OOP and (if needed) Design Patterns, TDD, Continuous Integration tools.

I follow PHP PSR standards, support CleanCode code concept, think that constant attention to application architecture (incremental improvements) and code refactoring are key factors to large project success.
