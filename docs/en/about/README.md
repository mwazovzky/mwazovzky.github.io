# General Information

I am a professional fullstack software developer passionate about modern web technologies.

I have years of experience implementing business applications (ERP/ERM/CRM).
Strong understanding of business process gives me opportunity to discuss
customer needs, document and decompose requirements, create project plan.

I have experience of developing complex app architecture,
building communication between apps (Rest API),
3rd party services, social networks (Facebook, Twitter) and messengers (Slack, Telegram)

TDD and Continuous Integration tools are part of my daily routine.

I follow industry coding standards (specifically PHP PSR), support CleanCode concept,
think that constant attention to application architecture (incremental improvements) and code refactoring are key factors to large project success.
